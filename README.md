# cartoonize-using-opencv
his Python script uses the OpenCV library to convert images into cartoon-style drawings. The script reads an image file, applies a bilateral filter and adaptive threshold to the image, and then merges the cartoonized image with the original image. The result is a cartoonized version of the input image, with crisp edges and smooth color transitions.
